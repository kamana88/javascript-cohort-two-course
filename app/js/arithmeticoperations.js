// What are arithmetic operations? - Arithmetic operations in JavaScript are mathematical operations that involve numbers and return a single value. Here are some common arithmetic operations in JavaScript:

//Addition (+) - This operation adds two numbers together. For example:

let num = 4;

let num1 = 5;

console.log(num + num1);

//the above will return 9.

//Subtraction (-) - This operation subtracts one number from another. For example:

console.log(num - num1);

//the above will return -1.

//Multiplication (*) - This operation multiplies two numbers together. For example:

console.log(num * num1);

//the above will return 20.

//Division (/) - This operation divides one number by another. For example:

console.log(num / num1);

//the above will return 0.8

//Modulus (%) - This operation returns the remainder after dividing one number by another. For example:

console.log(num1 % num);

//the above will return 1

//Exponentiation (**): This operation raises the first number to the power of the second number. For example,

console.log(num ** num1);

//the above will return 1024

//Increment (++) - This operation adds one to the number. For example:

console.log(num++);

//the above will return 5

//Decrement (--) - This operation subtracts one from the number. For example:

console.log(num1--);

//the above will return 4

// N/B Javascript obeys all the mathematical rules. I an instance where you are doing a multi expression always obey the BODMAS rule.
