//What are operations in javascript?- In JavaScript, operators are symbols that perform specific mathematical or logical operations on one or more operands. These operands can be variables, constants, or expressions. Operators are used to perform a variety of tasks, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and comparison.

//There are several different types of operators in JavaScript, including:

//Arithmetic operators: These operators perform mathematical operations on one or more operands. Examples include the addition (+) operator, the subtraction (-) operator, the multiplication (*) operator, and the division (/) operator.

//Assignment operators: These operators assign a value to a variable. Examples include the assignment (=) operator, the addition assignment (+=) operator, and the subtraction assignment (-=) operator.

//Comparison operators: These operators compare two operands and return a Boolean value indicating whether the comparison is true or false. Examples include the equality (==) operator, the inequality (!=) operator, the greater than (>) operator, and the less than (<) operator.

//Logical operators: These operators perform logical operations on one or more operands. Examples include the logical AND (&&) operator, the logical OR (||) operator, and the logical NOT (!) operator.

// Increment and decrement operators: These operators increment or decrement the value of a variable by one. Examples include the increment (++) operator and the decrement (--) operator.

//Bitwise operators: These operators perform bitwise operations on one or more operands. Examples include the AND (&) operator, the OR (|) operator, and the XOR (^) operator.
