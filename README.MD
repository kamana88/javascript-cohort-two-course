# INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT

This ia a beginner guide to javascript. In this course we are going to guide you through this course and after this I believe you are going to be a javascript Guru. We are going to start from basics to advanced concepts

The belows shows the sequence in which we shall be having the topics.

## How to run the files.

if you are using the browser, always remember to link the specific topics file to the index.html file using the script tag ie:-
    <script src="./{file location in the js folder}"></script>

most of the actions hapenning in this cours can be viewed from the console log. So after running the html file, open the console log of your browser to see the results. Every step in this repository has been explained in the comments.

For the projects and the exercise files, you dont have to link any file.
